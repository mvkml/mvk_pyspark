## About This Repository
This repository is created and maintained by Vishnu Kiran M to demonstrate practical knowledge of PySpark and large-scale data engineering concepts. The focus is on building scalable, distributed data processing solutions using Python, aligned with real-world enterprise use cases such as ETL pipelines, analytics, and AI-driven data platforms.

The repository is intended for learning, demonstration, and portfolio purposes, showcasing how PySpark is used in modern cloud and big-data ecosystems.

## What is PySpark?
PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark, an open-source distributed computing framework designed for processing large datasets efficiently. It enables developers to use Python to perform data transformations, analytics, and machine learning on data that may not fit into a single machine’s memory.

PySpark provides high-level abstractions such as DataFrames and Spark SQL, supports in-memory computation, and executes workloads in parallel across clusters, making it ideal for big data processing.

## History of PySpark
Apache Spark was originally developed in 2009 at the UC Berkeley AMPLab to address the limitations of disk-based data processing systems like Hadoop MapReduce. Spark introduced in-memory computation, significantly improving performance for iterative and interactive workloads.

PySpark was later introduced to allow Python developers to leverage Spark’s distributed processing capabilities. Over time, PySpark evolved into a first-class API, widely adopted in enterprise platforms such as Azure Databricks, AWS EMR, and Google Dataproc, becoming a core tool in modern data engineering.
